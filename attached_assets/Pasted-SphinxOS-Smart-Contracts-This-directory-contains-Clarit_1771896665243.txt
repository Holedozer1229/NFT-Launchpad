pox-automation.clar

Purpose: Automated PoX (Proof of Transfer) delegation with BTC yield routing.

Features:

✅ Non-custodial STX delegation
✅ DAO-controlled pool operator
✅ User-initiated revocation
✅ On-chain audit trail
✅ BTC yield routing to treasury
Key Functions:

;; Governance (DAO only)
(set-pool (new-pool principal)) → Changes pool operator

;; User functions
(delegate (amount uint)) → Delegate STX to current pool
(revoke-delegation) → Revoke your delegation

;; Read-only
(get-pool) → Get current pool operator
(get-total-delegated) → Get total STX delegated
(get-user-delegation (user principal)) → Get user's delegation info
(get-stats) → Get contract statistics
Security Properties:

Non-Custodial: STX never transferred, only delegated
Revocable: Users can withdraw anytime
DAO-Controlled: Pool operator managed by governance
Immutable Economics: Core rules cannot be upgraded
🚀 Deployment

Prerequisites

Clarinet CLI tool
Stacks wallet with testnet STX
Deploy to Testnet

# Using Clarinet
clarinet integrate
clarinet deploy contracts/pox-automation.clar --testnet

# Or using Stacks CLI
stx deploy_contract pox-automation contracts/pox-automation.clar --testnet
Deploy to Mainnet

clarinet deploy contracts/pox-automation.clar --mainnet
⚠️ Important: Update DAO and TREASURY addresses before mainnet deployment!

🧪 Testing

Unit Tests

Create contracts/pox-automation_test.clar:

;; Test delegation
(define-public (test-delegate)
  (let ((result (contract-call? .pox-automation delegate u10000000000)))
    (asserts! (is-ok result) (err u1))
    (ok true)))

;; Test revocation
(define-public (test-revoke)
  (let ((result (contract-call? .pox-automation revoke-delegation)))
    (asserts! (is-ok result) (err u2))
    (ok true)))
Run tests:

clarinet test
Integration Tests

# Deploy to local devnet
clarinet integrate

# Test delegation
clarinet console
> (contract-call? .pox-automation delegate u10000000000)

# Check stats
> (contract-call? .pox-automation get-stats)
📊 Usage Examples

For Users

;; 1. Delegate 10,000 STX
(contract-call? .pox-automation delegate u10000000000)

;; 2. Check your delegation
(contract-call? .pox-automation get-user-delegation tx-sender)

;; 3. Revoke when you want
(contract-call? .pox-automation revoke-delegation)
For DAO

;; Rotate pool operator (requires DAO authority)
(contract-call? .pox-automation set-pool 'ST2NEW_POOL_ADDRESS)

;; Check pool history
(contract-call? .pox-automation get-pool-history u12345)
🔐 Security

Audit Checklist

 DAO address verified
 Treasury address verified
 No custodial transfers
 Revocation always allowed
 Pool history immutable
 Error codes comprehensive
Known Limitations

BTC Routing: Pool operator receives BTC off-chain and must route to treasury

Mitigation: DAO can rotate dishonest operators
Transparency: On-chain pool history for auditing
Cycle Timing: Delegation updates once per cycle

Impact: Users must wait for next cycle
Standard: Matches Stacks PoX behavior
🔄 Upgrade Path

The contracts are non-upgradable by design for security. To upgrade:

Deploy new version
DAO announces migration
Users revoke from old contract
Users delegate to new contract
Treasury routing updated
Why non-upgradable?

Prevents DAO from modifying economics
Prevents unauthorized access to funds
Users trust immutable code
📈 Economics

Yield Distribution

R = α · (S / ΣS_i) · R_total
Where:

R: BTC reward per user
α: Pool efficiency (0.92-0.98)
S: User's STX delegation
ΣS_i: Total STX in pool
R_total: Total BTC rewards
Treasury Split

R_T = R · min(0.30, 0.05 + Φ/2000)
Base: 5%
Max: 30%
Higher Φ = Higher treasury share
